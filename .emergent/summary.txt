<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles a diligent and iterative development process for a driving appointment management application. Starting from an MVP, the engineer systematically addressed user feedback to expand functionality and improve user experience. Key accomplishments include implementing robust authentication (pattern lock, remember me), comprehensive appointment management (duplication, status updates), and a detailed income reporting system with various filters. Significant effort was dedicated to UI/UX refinements, such as form layout optimization, full Traditional Chinese localization for calendars and labels, and real-time input validation for time conflicts. The engineer also introduced SMS notification generation, configurable settings (appointment types, SMS templates, language, date format), and addressed issues like invisible buttons and date picker usability. The work consistently demonstrated a responsiveness to detailed user requests, culminating in efforts to enhance accessibility through font size adjustment and ensuring mobile landscape responsiveness.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the final stages of enhancing the application's accessibility and adaptability. The immediate focus is on two user-requested features:

1.  **Font Size Adjustment:** The user requested the ability to change the application's font size for improved readability. The engineer has identified that the UI control for this feature should reside in . Furthermore, it has been confirmed that  already contains the necessary underlying logic () to dynamically adjust the global font size on the DOM. The next step is to connect the UI control to this existing logic.

2.  **Mobile Landscape Responsiveness:** The user also requested that the application display correctly when viewed on mobile devices in landscape orientation. The engineer has proactively checked  and verified the presence of existing CSS media queries designed to handle  orientation on various screen sizes, providing a solid foundation for this feature.

The frontend service was restarted following these checks to ensure the environment is ready for further implementation and testing of these enhancements.

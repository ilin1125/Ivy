The AI engineer successfully built a driving appointments tracking application from scratch, iteratively adding features based on user feedback. The process started with clarifying core requirements, then proceeded with initial implementation in FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend), with MongoDB for data persistence, all in Traditional Chinese. Early tests by a testing agent quickly identified and fixed UI issues. Subsequent iterations focused on enhancing user experience: implementing color-coded appointment types, robust authentication (password, 4x4 pattern lock, remember me), a unified settings interface, and crucial features like appointment duplication and income tracking. Data migration was performed to adapt to new schema changes, demonstrating a systematic approach to evolving requirements and technical challenges. The work concluded with refining the income reporting and form layout, showcasing continuous improvement and responsiveness to detailed user requests.

<product_requirements>
The user, a driver named 輝哥, required a full-stack application to track driving appointments. The app needed to support:
1.  **Appointment Management:** Capture client name, pickup time/location, expected arrival time/location, flight information, and other details.
2.  **Multilingual Support:** All UI and functionalities must be in Traditional Chinese.
3.  **Views:** Both list and calendar views for appointments, with the calendar view resembling Google Calendar, showing up to five events per day.
4.  **Authentication:**
    *   Password login.
    *   A 4x4 image pattern unlock option.
    *   A Remember Me (自動登入) feature for password-less access.
5.  **Customization:**
    *   Ability for the driver to set custom appointment types, including text, icons, and colors.
    *   All these settings (圖案設定 and 類型設定) should be unified under a single 設定 interface with tabs.
6.  **Data Persistence & Backup:** All data to be backed up to MongoDB (雲端 MongoDB).
7.  **Enhanced Usability:**
    *   Easy move, delete, and change appointments.
    *   複製行程 (Duplicate Appointment) functionality to quickly create recurring appointments, pre-filling data and automatically syncing pickup/arrival dates/times.
    *   接送 (Pickup) terminology to be changed to 接客.
    *   行李數量 (Luggage Count) field initially, then changed to 行李/人數 (Luggage/Passengers) with driver input, then temporarily removed, and finally re-added.
8.  **Financial Tracking:**
    *   Income calculation and a 儲值 (top-up) mechanism.
    *   Amount field for each appointment should be editable, not fixed at zero.
    *   Income report showing total and per-client income within a specified date range. This report should also include filtering by 類型 (type), remove 平均收入, and display 當月收入 on the homepage.
9.  **Form Layout:** Optimized form layout with 接客時間 and 接客地點 on one line, and 抵達時間 and 抵達地點 on one line.
